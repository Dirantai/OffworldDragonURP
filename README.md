# Offworld Dragon Supernova URP
URP variant of my Offworld project

So far the project is an absolute mess, this is a prototype through and through.
It is intended really to further my own knowledge of unity's wackiness, such as fun shaders
and what not.

If you're interested, go hogwild with a fork. But I do warn you this is probably one of the worst and messiest
things you have ever witnessed as a programmer

This ReadMe will be updated once I have something better to write, but for now, enjoy it.
